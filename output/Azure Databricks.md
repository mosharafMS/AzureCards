## Security		<img src="../img/3star.png" width=100 />  
The following features are common for security-conscious organizations. All but SSO require the Premium plan. 
 - Single sign-on (SSO): Authenticate users using Azure Active Directory. This is always enabled and is the only option. If you use a different IdP, federate your IdP with Azure Active Directory.
 - Role-based access control: Control access to clusters, jobs, data tables, APIs, and workspace resources such as notebooks, folders, jobs, and registered models.
 - Credential passthrough: Control access to Azure Data Lake Storage using usersâ€™ Azure Active Directory credentials.
 - VNet injection: Deploy an Azure Databricks workspace in your own VNet that you manage in your Azure subscription. Enables you to implement custom network configuration with custom Network Security Group rules. 
 - Secure cluster connectivity: Enable secure cluster connectivity on the workspace, which means that your VNetâ€™s Network Security Group (NSG) has no open inbound ports and Databricks Runtime cluster nodes have no public IP addresses. Also known as 'No Public IPs.' You can enable this feature for a workspace during deployment. This feature is in Public Preview.
